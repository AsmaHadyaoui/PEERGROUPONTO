## Overview

The PEERGROUPONTO ontology is part of an ongoing effort to improve the effectiveness of e-learning platforms by fostering collaborative learning in diverse educational settings. This ontology provides a detailed framework for capturing educational interactions, learner profiles, and group dynamics, facilitating a more efficient, adaptive, and personalized approach to learning assessments.

## Features

- **Learner Performance**: Track and assess the performance of individual learners in collaborative environments.
- **Collaborative Learning Strategies**: Model various strategies for team-based learning and group dynamics.
- **Adaptive Feedback**: Provide real-time feedback based on learner interactions and group performance.
- **Semantic Web Integration**: Use RDF and OWL to enable machine-readable, reusable data and enhance interoperability with other systems.
- **Group Interactions**: Represent group interactions, including collaborative problem-solving and peer-based learning.

## Technologies Used

- **OWL** (Web Ontology Language)
- **RDF** (Resource Description Framework)
- **Semantic Web Technologies**
- **Machine Learning** (for future extensions in adaptive learning models)
- **SPARQL** (for querying the ontology data)

## Usage

To use this ontology, you will need an ontology editor like [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) to load and explore the ontology. You can also use SPARQL endpoints for querying the data or integrate it into educational platforms for adaptive learning and assessment.

### Example SPARQL Query

Here’s an example of how you can query for learner performance data:

# sparql
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/ontology#>
SELECT ?learner ?performance
WHERE {
  ?learner ex:hasPerformance ?performance .
}
